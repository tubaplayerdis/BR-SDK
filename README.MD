# BR-SDK

Welcome to the BR-SDK. This SDK is meant to help people develop and publish **DLL based mods** for Brick Rigs. It is the most **comprehensive and complete** SDK of Brick Rigs and will be updates as Brick Rigs updates. This SDK **WILL NOT** help with the creation of weapons/map creation mods. Those  type of mods are created using the BRMK. To find  more information relating to BRMK, join the official Brick Rigs Discord server.

## Limitations

 - Creating custom maps
 - Creating custom weapons
 - Creating custom bricks
 - Creating anything that is related to .pak mods and or **content** mod-derieved

All of these things require the BRMK, a proprietary modding platform for Brick Rigs, which is not distributed by me or related to this project in any way.

## Uses

 - Modifying Gamemodes
 - Modifying character behavior
 - Creating UI Elements natively
 - **Modifying game behavior**
 - Managment systems
 - Low-level access to the game

These abilities are what is in the domain of a regular "mod" for most games and works on the basics of game hacking and reverse engineering.
BR-SDK provides a way to interact with Brick Rigs programmatically and for the **modification of game behavior**.

# Installation

To get started using the SDK, follow the following installation guided based on your IDE of choice. The guides posted are for JetBrains Rider and Microsoft Visual Studio. If using another IDE/Build System, the process should be relatively the same just adjusted for your IDE/Build System as needed.
